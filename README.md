During our studying in IAU we were working with different types of projects. There were web and desktop applications, 3D modeling tasks and many other things. All these were amazing, but we never could implement it in real life. This project is not going to be the same. Our team is going to work not only for educational purposes- we also want to use it with a real goal in real life.
         	That’s gonna be a web application for aspiring entrepreneurs whose business is connected with building landscape design. Our goal is to create a beautiful business card website.According to global statistics a  business card website is a really important thing to develop and spread the idea of your  services. 
So, we wish good luck ourselves and let’s start!
